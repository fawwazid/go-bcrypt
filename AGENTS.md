# Agent instructions

This repository is the `go-bcrypt` Go module. Keep changes within this module
unless the task explicitly spans other repositories. Preserve existing user
changes. Do not create or edit changelogs; Release Please generates them.

## Security and API

- Treat bcrypt as a legacy password-storage option; recommend Argon2id for
  non-FIPS deployments and approved PBKDF2 where FIPS is required.
- Preserve the 12–16 cost policy and reject passwords over 72 bytes without
  truncation or implicit pre-hashing.
- Fail closed in FIPS mode; do not substitute another algorithm implicitly.
- Keep `NeedsRehash` and stored-cost handling consistent with the allowed cost
  policy. Do not describe this package as independently FIPS-certified.

## Development

- Workspace mail invariant: `go-mail` caps messages at 1,000 recipients, 100
  attachments, and 25 MiB; untrusted attachment bytes use its checked API.
- Workspace MFA invariant: `ConstantTimeCompare` rejects strings longer than
  4,096 UTF-8 bytes before allocating byte slices.

- Target the Go version in `go.mod`; format Go changes with `gofmt`.
- Keep `README.md` and `SECURITY.md` aligned with password limits and policy.
- Remove only clearly unused internal code; preserve exported APIs unless a
  breaking change is explicitly requested.
- Add or update regression tests for every code change and run the affected
  module's complete test suite before finishing. Run `go vet ./...` as well.
- Review password-storage changes against OWASP guidance and the package's
  FIPS policy; preserve the 72-byte limit and fail-closed behavior.
- For every workspace code, test, or security-policy change, review and update
  all eight module-level `AGENTS.md` files in the same change set so their
  constraints and test-coverage notes stay aligned. Keep updates concise; this
  is not a changelog.

## Test coverage notes

- `bcrypt_test.go` covers invalid `NeedsRehash` target costs as well as valid
  upgrade and no-upgrade cases.

## Release workflow

- Use Conventional Commit pull request titles so squash merges produce the
  intended SemVer bump: `fix:` for patch, `feat:` for minor, and `!` or
  `BREAKING CHANGE:` for major. Use `fix(security):` for security fixes;
  `security:` alone does not bump a version.
- `docs:`, `test:`, `chore:`, and `ci:` do not trigger a release. Release
  Please opens or updates a release pull request; merge that generated PR to
  create the version tag and GitHub release.
- Never create or edit changelogs manually; Release Please generates them.
- Keep the temporary `last-release-sha` at the v2 preparation commit during this rollout: the existing v2.0.0 tag is not on `main` history. After the first generated v2.0.1 release PR is merged and tagged, remove this fixed marker in a chore PR so later releases track the latest tag automatically.
## Branches and pull requests

- Start from the repository's default branch and create a branch for each
  change. Do not commit directly to the default branch.
- Use lowercase type prefixes and concise kebab-case descriptions for branch
  names: `feat/<description>`, `fix/<description>`, `docs/<description>`,
  `refactor/<description>`, `test/<description>`, `chore/<description>`, or
  `security/<description>`.
- Follow Conventional Commits for commit messages:
  `<type>(<optional-scope>): <imperative summary>`. Keep the summary concise,
  lowercase, and without a final period. Use `!` before the colon and a
  `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer for breaking changes.
- Open a pull request for each branch. Use a Conventional Commit title so
  squash merges and release automation produce the intended version change.
  Follow the release types and exceptions described above in this file.
- Describe what changed and why, note user or API impact, and report relevant
  checks and their results. Mention security, compatibility, or migration
  considerations when applicable, and link related issues when available.
- Keep pull requests focused and satisfy the repository's required checks and
  review policy before merging.
